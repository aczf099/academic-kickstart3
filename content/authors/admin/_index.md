Hello,

I am an Economist at the OECD in Paris since 2016, where I work in the International Finance Unit in the Investment Division. Before 2016, I worked for the risk analysis team at the European Systemic Risk Board in Frankfurt.

I have expertise in:
- financial regulation, systemic risk, macroprudential policy
- international finance, capital flow management, FX policies
- financial services - market access and cross border provision
