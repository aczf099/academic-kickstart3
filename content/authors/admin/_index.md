Welcome !

I am an Economist at the OECD in Paris since 2016, where I work in the International Finance unit in the Investment Division on capital flows and capital controls.  
Before that, I worked for the Risk Analysis team at the European Systemic Risk Board (ECB) in Frankfurt on systemic risk measurement and macroprudential policy effectiveness.  
I received my PhD from City, University of London and a dual master degree from Sciences Po and the London School of Economics. 

I am co-organising the [BdF-BoE-IMF-OECD annual Workshop on International Capital Flows]([https://www.oecd.org/investment/investment-policy/capital-flows-workshop.htm](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/events/2024/october/5th-international-capital-flows-and-financial-policies-workshop)) and the [OECD session at the Central Bank Research Association (CEBRA) Annual Conference](https://www.cebra-events.org/). I am also since 2021 a core instructor in the [ESRB-ECB led EUI/FBF Course on Macroprudential Policy Implementation](https://fbf.eui.eu/course/macroprudential-policy-implementation-academy/). I was also a Visiting Researcher at the Bank of Finland Institute for Emerging Economies (BOFIT). 

I have published my research in international finance and political economy journals such as the IMF Economic Review, Journal of Banking and Finance, European Journal of Political Economy, International Journal of Central Banking, International Journal of Finance & Economics, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions & Money, Review of World Economics, Revue d'Economie Financi√®re, Economy & Society, Regulation & Governance, and New Political Economy. 

On this website you can find my research publications and work in progress, as well as some photography!
